## Description:

- This is a play on the classic "Hangman" game. The player can't lose, but they get to build a snowman by adding parts every time a correct letter is chosen from a hidden word. I chose to add a "Play Again" button when the game ends as well as changes in game status headings.

- Uses a JSON file, React components and state to update the DOM dynamically.

### Built with:

- JavaScript - https://www.javascript.com/

- React.js - https://reactjs.org/

- CSS
